# Eaon

A native macOS chat client, built with SwiftUI. Talk to [Eaon](https://eaon.dev)'s
hosted models, bring your own API key for any OpenAI-compatible/Anthropic/Gemini
provider, or run models entirely on-device with Ollama, llama.cpp, or MLX —
all from the same app, with no account required for the local-only path.

## Highlights

- **Multi-provider chat** — Eaon's hosted catalog, BYOK cloud providers, and
  local models, with automatic routing based on which model you pick.
- **Local models** — discover and run GGUF/MLX models via Ollama, llama.cpp,
  or Apple's MLX framework, with live hardware-fit checks before you download
  anything.
- **Plugins** — connect real accounts (GitHub, Slack, Notion, Linear, and
  more) and let a model call their tools directly, with native tool-calling
  and a confirmation step before anything runs.
- **Image generation** — over an API or a local server (Automatic1111-style,
  or an Ollama-served diffusion model).
- **Computer Control** — optional, off by default — let a model organize
  files or run shell commands on this Mac, with safety rules and
  confirmation built in.
- **Local API Server** — run Eaon itself as a local, OpenAI-compatible
  server other tools can point at.
- **Memory** — Eaon can learn durable facts about you across conversations,
  entirely on-device.

## Quick start

Clone the repository, then run the development launcher:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sanscreates/eaon-desktop.git
cd eaon-desktop
./run.sh
```

The launcher builds Eaon and starts it as a detached macOS app process.

## Building

Requires Xcode 15+ / Swift 5.9+ and macOS 14+.

```sh
swift build
./run.sh            # builds and launches for local development
```

To produce a distributable universal build (arm64 + x86_64), see
`build-installer.sh` and `RELEASING-UPDATES.md`.
