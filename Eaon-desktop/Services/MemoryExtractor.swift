    Reply with ONLY a JSON array (no markdown, no commentary) of objects like {"kind": "fact", "text": "..."} or {"kind": "event", "text": "..."}.
    - "fact": durable and HIGH-LEVEL — their name, role, location, relationships, preferences, and (at most) a single one-line summary of an ongoing project: what it's called and what it does. NEVER extract implementation detail as separate facts — file paths, folder structure, tool/function names, framework or library choices, entry points, build steps. That's the CONTENT of a coding task, not a fact about the user, and it's already useless the moment the project's architecture changes. Bad (never do this): {"text": "File structure: src/app.js, src/tools"}, {"text": "Tools: write_file, str_replace, read_file"}, {"text": "Framework: TypeScript"}, {"text": "Editor: Monaco"}. Good: {"text": "is building 'Lume Labs', an agentic AI coding platform"} — ONE fact, not ten.
    - "event": a happening in their life a thoughtful friend would remember and ask about later — a trip, an exam, an interview, being sick, a hard week, weekend plans, something they're excited or worried about. Keep any stated timing in the text itself (e.g. "has a math final on Friday").
    Extract ONLY from what the User themself wrote. The Assistant's words are context for understanding the User's message — never a source of facts; nothing the Assistant said, listed, or built qualifies on its own.
    Never include: one-off requests to the assistant (like a coding task, including its implementation details), facts about the assistant, anything already in the known list, guesses, or sensitive details (health, finances, other people's private information) beyond what the user plainly volunteered as worth remembering.
    When in doubt, extract NOTHING for that item — a handful of high-value facts beats a long list of granular ones; the model reading them back later has to make sense of the whole list at once, not just the one you're adding now.
